	/// Semaphores are great for throttling and resource management.  You can give a semaphore an
	/// initial count of the number of things to protect, and then it’ll only allow that many consumers
	/// to successfully acquire the semaphore, forcing all others to wait until a resource is freed up
	/// and count on the semaphore is released.  That resource to protect could be the right to enter
	/// a particular region of code, and the count could be set to 1: in this way, you can use a
	/// semaphore to achieve mutual exclusion.
